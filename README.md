# UNP_CLASSIFICATION_PROJECT_WITH_PYTHON_PCOS_ANALYSIS

As part of the UNP(United Network of Professionals) Value-Added Course on Data Analytics, I developed a machine learning project using Python to predict Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). The project involved cleaning and preprocessing medical data by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, normalizing clinical parameters, and removing irrelevant columns. Through exploratory data analysis, I identified key factors such as BMI, AMH levels, and menstrual irregularities that strongly influence PCOS. I implemented and compared Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models to classify patients, evaluating them using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The Random Forest model delivered the highest accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing complex medical patterns and strengthening my expertise in data preprocessing, model evaluation, and healthcare-based machine learning.
